# WipeCore

**WipeCore** is a low-level, high-safety disk wiping tool for Windows, written in Rust.  
It securely overwrites entire physical drives using multi-pass zeroing or random data — while automatically detecting and protecting the Windows system disk so you never wipe the wrong drive by accident.
